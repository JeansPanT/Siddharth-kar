Glad to see you here!  
I am currently studying CSE in 2nd year at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. Passionate about coding and creating innovative solutions. I enjoy diving into the world of technology to build meaningful projects. When not in front of the screen, you'll find me immersed in a good book, expressing myself on canvas, spiking a volleyball, or simply enjoying the rhythm of my favorite tunes. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of tech and creativity! 🚀
